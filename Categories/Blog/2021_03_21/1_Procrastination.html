    <p><blockquote>When a dear sees an incoming car, it freezes... Fight, flight, and freeze are fear responses. All of these responses make sense and can save our lives... Yet, there are circumstances,in which these recations are maladaptive.<a href="https://pmigdal.medium.com/dont-fight-flight-or-freeze-your-body-and-emotions-96f5aa30b299">-Piotr Midgal</a> </blockquote> </p>
    <p>  Author Piotr Migdal likens and relates our daily life experiences to the three fear responses, fight, flight and freeze.</p>
    <p>When handling different aspects of our lives, the reaction to those aspects can be related back to the fear responses. In the situation of work or studies, Fight would refer to the deadline crunch that we all once knew so well as students. Flight would be the procrastination we face especially when handling work that we aren't particularly fond of.</p>
    <p>  The author has also related this to other aspects of life such as Relationships and reactions to Bodily sensations. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26371848">Further Discussion on Hacker News forum</a></p>
