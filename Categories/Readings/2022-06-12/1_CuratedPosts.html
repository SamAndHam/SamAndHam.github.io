only 20. Has the world always felt like this? Does it always feel like
we're on the brink of awful things and everything could go up in flames
tomorrow? Or is this an outlier?</a></p>
<p>There have always been people in the world who felt like it was
"going to hell in a hand basket." But if you could survey everybody and
put their responses on a bell curve, you'd probably have more negative
viewpoints right now. It wouldn't be a nice even distribution, I don't
think. I don't know enough about statistical analysis to say how many
deviations would qualify this current situation as an outlier.</p>
<p>We definitely have serious challenges, but the other thing worth
considering is that there have always been serious challenges and times
of great upheaval throughout history. What's hard to figure out, for me,
is how the impact of modern technology <em>amplifies the signal</em> of
all that bad stuff and makes it seem much worse in our minds.</p>
<p>When I was 8 years old, I lived in a house that did not have cable TV
or internet. We had an antenna on the roof that got TV reception for
about five or six channels. That's all we had. And back then, the news
was reported once in the morning, once at dinner time, and one final
time late at night.</p>
<p>So when something awful happened, like the attempted assassination of
President Reagan, you only heard about it three or four times a day, and
that was if you were checking TV, radio, and newspapers. The flow of
information was slower.</p>
<p>Now, when something bad happens, you marinate in it all day long.
They replay it endlessly on TV, it's on the internet 24 hours a day. The
signal is way, way more powerful. That has to have an effect on us
psychologically.</p>
<p>Again, we definitely have big big problems. I don't want to minimize
them in any way. I'm trying to figure out how we differentiate our
perception of previous awful things from current awful things.</p>
<p>How do we compare living through the pandemic to living through the
black plague?How do we compare living in the information age to living
through the industrial revolution?How do we compare living in a time of
mass shootings to living in the time of the Civil War or WWII when so
many young people lost their lives?</p>
<p>It's all suffering, right? Victor Frankl wrote in "Man's Search for
Meaning" that human beings have a tendency to compare their suffering to
the suffering of others, like placing weights on a scale to see which
outweighs the other. He suggested that suffering is like a gas, rather
than a solid, and our bodies are the container. The gas expands to fill
the container, no matter what. That has always stuck with me.</p>

is it that suddenly whole of the country is understaffed?</a> </p>
<p>Can't believe people aren't recognising the demographic shift, 2022
is the year that the bulk of boomers hit retirement age, they are the
largest generation by far with the generations after them being too
small to fill the void in the job market. As the boomers retire from
management everyone moves up the chain and therefore consequently there
are simply less people to work in low paid jobs. The covid pandemic
accelerated this trend because many boomers took early retirement
believing the juice is no longer worth the squeeze. Demographics never
lie and we are headed for 40 years of pepetual economic decline due to
lower population and therefore economic growth outlooks.</p>

Youth Unemployment to Hit 23%, Bank of America Says</a></p>
<p>Why do so many countries with aging populations have so many
unemployed young people? </p>
<p>It could be due to labor market segmentation and intergenerational
frictions. Older people do not value the work that younger workers do
(e.g. creative content, technology), and younger workers are not keen to
get into the industries that cater to the old (e.g., healthcare, house
cleaning).</p>
<p>I’d think that with old people hitting retirement that there would be
a problem with not enough young workers but across the world whenever a
population ages the young experience more unemployment.</p>
<p>This is called the Lump of Labor Fallacy, it assumes a fixed amount
of work so that retiring workers "leave holes" for new entrants to fill.
It is a fallacy, in usual circumstances, because in theory and practice
growing labor forces beget more labor growth. Growth in labor becomes
growth income, meaning more jobs are created. The number of slots is not
fixed. I don't think labor markets function as smoothly as economists
tend to argue, but this is the classic explanation for why a rapidly
aging workforce is not good for younger workers.</p>

Resignation: Time to Get Rid of Managers and Empower Employees</a></p>
<p>Being a good manager is the hardest job in the world and goes against
most people's human nature. You have to step back behind the team when
praise is given and step in front of the team when they are
critized.</p>

href="https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/udm5tb/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_an_engine/">ELI5:
What is the difference between an engine built for speed, and an engine
built for power</a></p>
<p>Dear God, the answers here are terrible.</p>
<p>The short answer is that there's not a difference.</p>
<p>Powerful engines have high power output, meaning horsepower. Torque
is a measure of angular force, which means force of twist, or how hard
it twists.</p>
<p>Horsepower is, mathematically, torque multiplied by revolutions per
minute divided by 5252 (just trust the constant, the explanation isn't
relevant for this).</p>
<p>So how to you get high horsepower? You use high torque or you have
high rpms. High rpms mean more movement, which means more friction and
less efficiency.</p>
<p>Higher torque means the engine has to be able to take higher internal
forces (since torque IS rotational force), which means it's heavier.
Heavier is often bad for a race car.</p>
<p>So the answers about diesel being heavier, but making more torque are
right then, right? I'm mad over nothing!</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>Let's look at the most prolific engine family of all time, the Chevy
small block. Specifically, let's look at the 3rd and 4th gen, the LS
family. </p>
<p>The same engines were routinely used BOTH in trucks and Corvettes.
Sure, they'd get tweaks to push the horsepower a bit higher in the
Corvette, or a bit more low end torque for the LQ (truck designated)
engines, but they're ALMOST identical. So what gives?</p>
<p>The definition of torque. That's what.</p>
<p>Torque is force at some distance from the centerline. Basically, if
you put a 1lb weight on an arm 1 ft long, you have 1 ft-lb of twist. If
you double the length? The same 1 lb is now doing 2ft-lb of twist.</p>
<p>So how's the Corvette, a high performance sports car, using a truck
motor that doesn't rev very high? One word: gearing. </p>
<p>ANY engine can have ANY torque value at the tires, which is where
it's measured. As Archimedes said, give me a long enough lever, and a
fulcrum on which to place it, and I will move the world.</p>
<p>Any engine can be a race car engine. Any engine can be a truck
engine. The energy output per second, or power, is all that matters.
With gears, you can reshape your power to be used however you need,
speed or grunt.</p>
<p>So why do semis use diesel? Because it's cheaper. That's it. Diesel
is cheaper per used power because diesel is more power dense than
gasoline. The higher compression ratio is more efficient. Glow plugs
last longer than spark plugs. Diesel engines last longer and are simpler
to repair when they do fail.</p>
<p>The claims on shorter piston movements meaning more power but less
efficiency? True, because of friction losses in longer strokes with
higher RPM. That higher RPM, we we saw in the equation, means more
power. </p>
<p>TL;DR: there's virtually no difference in the engines. The
transmissions are where the differences are. Diesels are used because
they're efficient and reliable.</p>

Request: How does one work a 40hr a week job and not make it feel like
it’s taking up all my time?</a></p>
<p>What’s worked for me is :</p>
<p>-Consistent sleep schedule</p>
<p>-Setting boundaries at work (I’ll stay late to finish a task , but
more often than not, I’m gone at the time I’m scheduled to leave).</p>
<p>-Waking up 2.5 hrs before needing to be at work. Getting my some good
“me” time in the morning helps my mental state tremendously, and helps
the days to feel productively long. For years I would wake up a half
hour-1 hour before work and I would be rushing to get ready and out the
door. I no longer do that. </p>
<p>-learn something new everyday at your job. I promise when you’re
actively learning , time seems to slow down. EDIT: to further explain
this point , since a lot of people are asking “why would you wanna slow
time down?”. This tip is more so that you don’t look back and wonder
“where did the time go?” Time doesn’t feel like it’s passing you by when
you’re actively learning everyday , at least not for me. </p>
<p>Your mileage may vary, but these things have helped me to feel like
my life is not just work. I’m huge on work/life balance , and these
things have helped me to atleast feel like I’m in control of my life,
even if I’m working 40-45 hours like everyone else.</p>

how did banks clear checks and get funds from other banks before
computerization?</a></p>
<p>That is now the ACH process (Automated Clearing House).<br />
<a
href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/ach/">https://fiscal.treasury.gov/ach/</a>
</p>
<p>Now you have several basic systems:</p>
<p>ACH</p>
<p>Books and Stops</p>
<p>General Ledger</p>
<p>ATM\Base24</p>
<p>ACAPS\ALS\ICS</p>
<p>Wires (Yes wiring money is still a thing)</p>
<p>With Fintech you also have a collective set of Streaming systems.</p>
<p>The above 4 are tied to something called Batch Processing that
happens daily. Steaming systems are real time.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Either way those general systems all talk to one another across bank
regions (I believe there are 8 regions in the USA) so at any point Bank
A can make a call to Bank B via the appropriate channel and get
information in near-real time. ATM\Base24\Plastic Cards for example may
talk to the bank directly (Debit), the credit network
(Visa\Master\Diners\etc). </p>
<p>There are depending on how you count about 20-40 channels that banks
inter-communicate with depending on what they are asking for.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Batch will never go away since interest computations have to be taken
at some point so a 'batch' will still happen if only a few hours.</p>
<p>Transactions accumulate -&gt; Cutover Happens (Notice the deposits
after 4 pm will be processed the next business day? That is when a bank
does cutover) -&gt; Compute Time Based Transactions (aka Balancing the
Ledger) -&gt; Release Systems to new date\end cutover -&gt; Repeat. Some
systems can be moved to real time since their accruals aren't real-time,
case in point Mortgages. You aren't accruing interest daily, I think
they do weekly now, long ago was just computed monthly.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Even with streaming that cutover still has to happen at some point,
it is just a consequence of how interest functions in the financial
world (Daily Periodic Rate).</p>
<p>There is something internal at banks called Statement Cycles that
have to be processed. You have daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and
end of year that have to process. Oddly some statement cycles are
importantly that you would never think of, cycle 5, 7, 14 for example.
Oddly there are only I believe 18 (or is it 23?) statement cycles a
month, the minimum number of business days possible in a month. This is
different then a cycle date which is just a fancy way of saying a
business day. You would be surprised on how weird it is to calculate
interest.</p>
<p>Case point 365 days a year, but only 260 business days. Interest
accrues over the weekend but isn't processed until the next business day
so every Monday evening you are processing 3 days of interest. BUT if
you have monthly interest accruals then you are calculating either the
full month (30, 31, 28) days of interest but some instruments are
treated as only 28 days in a month of interest, regardless of the actual
number of days.</p>
<p>Here is why: the Annual interest rate is 2%. That means that legally
the daily periodic date is 2% / 365 days in the year. But rather to keep
things simple they say there are 12 months, each with 28 days of
interest bearing days so that 2%/336 days and they simply ignore the
extra days to make processing easier. You still get the 2%, just no
weirdness with variable number of days per month. That way the customer
gets a consistent monthly interest payment (assuming no balance change).
Just depends on the product and bank. Some systems just use the Julian
date 1-365 and computer via Julian dates (Common for daily interest). In
some countries you don't accumulate interest at all on non-business
days, those use the 260 day year. Some don't allow daily interest
calculations, only calculating interest monthly, quarterly, and for some
on Saturdays only.</p>
<p>It is a bizarre mess under the hood.</p>
