    <p>User u/rhetorical_twix on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lsyfcs/what_caused_stocks_to_dump_yesterday_the/?sort=confidence">Reddit</a> has noted a massive unwinding of positions in tech stocks and pandemic stocks, forcing institutions and trading professionals to change their portfolios to stocks that are oriented towards value. This rotation of funnds cannot be expected to be orderly and was partially triggered by a massive selling of bonds.<br> The market is now rejecting the Fed's view of the low interest persisting into the future with 6-7% growth being projected due to the stimulus plans.</p>

    <p>In the same post, user u/B0atingAccident makes an opposing stand that the rise in bond yields are to be expected and are a signal of a healthy economic recovery. The user points to the example of 1990's where stocks, tech stocks included, saw a dramatic rise. The current drop was noted to be a correction especially for stocks that have been overvalued.

    <p>Thoughts: Which sectors would benefit from the rotation of funds? Sectors which are of neccesity? Sectors that have primary access to funds?<br> Perhaps Banks, Materials , Energy and Industrial stocks might see a rise as the recovery takes place in the broader economy now</p>
