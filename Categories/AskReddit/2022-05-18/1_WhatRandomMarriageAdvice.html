<td><p>Don’t have too high of expectations. My dad told us that, but we
found most of our early fights were when one or the other had unspoken
expectations of the other or marriage. It is positively life changing to
be married, and an amazing experience, but still life goes on.</p>

<td><p>This is one I developed myself about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Don't forget to breathe.</p>
<p>Your relationship was founded on your individuality. If you are not
taking time to be yourselves as individuals, you are not maintaining
yourselves and eroding the foundation of you relationship and your life.
There is a reason most employers provide vacation. Time to get away from
the grindstone, reset, recharge, and breathe. Same thing for your
relationships. When you are together, you are a couple. When you are
with the kids, you are parents. At work, you are working. There is a
reason things like guy's/girl's night, man caves, and craft rooms exist.
To take time apart, build individually, and appreciate your time
together more. This is true of all relationships, romantic, parental,
vocational, and personal.</p>
<p>If you're not breathing, you're not doing much.</p>

<td><p>Looks fade, marry someone who you enjoy talking to. -grandma</p>
<p>I also feel strongly about this one. </p>
<p>Find someone who is ok with you both having separate hobbies. My wife
does her thing and I have my hobby. We share some hobbies, but we are ok
with spending time apart too. We don't have to always do them together.
I couldn't imagine marrying a woman who needed to do every single thing
I did just to be around me. She needs to have her own life and I love
not forcing her into the nerdy stuff I enjoy.</p>
