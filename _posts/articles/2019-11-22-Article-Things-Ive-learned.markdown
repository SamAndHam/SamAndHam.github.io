Comments take from the HN website providing valuable insight.

Quote from the [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21603920):

>Some things I've learned after 35 years;
>  1. learn how to communicate: being a good developer requires as much (more?) social as it does technical skills. I would recommend formal training and practice.
>   2. question all assumptions.
>   3. there is no silver bullet (read mythical man month).
>   4. fight complexity and over-engineering : get to your next MVP release.
>   5. always have a releasable build (stop talking and start coding).
>   6. code has little value in of itself; only rarely is a block of code reusable in other contexts.
>   7. requirements are a type of code, they should be written very precicely.
>   8. estimation is extrapolation (fortune telling) with unknown variables of an unknown function.
>   9. release as frequently as possible, to actual users, so you can discover the actual requirements.
>   10. coding is not a social activity.
